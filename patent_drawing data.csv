They may be formed as slits or ellipses or other such shapes However, the illus:rated rectangular shape is believed to be highly convenient and to result in the best overall distribution of sharpening and cleaning forces when the tape is pulled snugly against the table by mechanical means (not shown in the drawings because they form no novel part of the present invention), and is processed with the tensioning of about eight ounces."
6c0bqokb432a14w3yro68bf5s,4491485,"It is to be particularly noted that the pressure flow path by which the cleaning fluid is brought into contact with the lower surface of.the tape being cleaned is offset laterally across the table at different points along the path of the tape. The duct structure providing for this provides means to prevent a static (or neutral) flow condition at any point on the tape during the entire course of its path along the air table. Thus, it is highly improbable that any dirt particle could be carried along the entire air table without being pulled to left or right through the vertical wall apertures 22 and out of the system. Although there are a number of ways to achieve this effect, it has been found particularly useful to simply have the cleaning fluid pulled upwardly into ducts 20 through associated ducts 18 which are laterally offset from one another at different positions along the cleaning table, thereby providing the small differential in flow velocity and pressure required to achieve the desired effect"
