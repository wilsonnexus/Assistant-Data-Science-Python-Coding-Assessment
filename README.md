# Assistant-Data-Science-Python-Coding-Assessment
Regression Modeling, Edit-Distance Algorithm, Hamming Distance, and Data Cleaning
Author: Wilson Neira
This code contains the solutions to the Take-Home Coding Assessment: L2 Assistant Data Scientist.
Under main there are 4 function calls where:
	1. The regression_modeling() calls for the answers for questions 1. Regression Modelling.
	2. edit_distance_algorithm() calls for the answers for questions from 2. Implementing an Edit-Distance Algorithm.
	3. data_cleaning() calls for the answers for questions from 3. Data Cleaning.
	4. plt.show() plots the scatterplot for question 1 part b.

This code prints out all the solutions and plots graph all at once. If you want to print some of the questions indidually, you can comment out the corresponding functions.
